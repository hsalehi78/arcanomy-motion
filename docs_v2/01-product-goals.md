# Product Goals (v2)

## Goal

Ship one reel per day with near-zero ambiguity.

This app’s purpose is to output a **CapCut-ready kit** that can be assembled mechanically (no “creative invention” at assembly time).

## Non-goals

- Fully automated “final.mp4” export (CapCut remains the final editor).
- Generating visuals before the beat sheet is asset-complete.
- Browsing the internet during production (all assets resolved from local libraries or deterministic fallbacks).

## Definition of Done (per daily run)

A run is “done” when:

- The **claim is locked** and deduped against history
- The **script is verified** against proof anchors
- The **beat sheet is asset-complete**
- All required assets are resolved (or valid fallbacks are generated)
- A CapCut kit exists with a single `edit_plan.md` that an editor can follow without guessing
- The Concept Ledger entry is appended (so tomorrow’s dedupe is real)
