# motion_v2 (Scaffold for the rebuild)

This folder is a **starter scaffold** you can copy into a new repo.

It is intentionally minimal and aligned to `docs_v2/03-repo-layout.md`.

## What exists right now

- A tiny Python CLI app (`reels`) with **one command**:
  - `reels init` → creates a run folder + writes `run_context.json`

## Next steel-thread steps

- Day 2: `reels claim` + `reels script` (no pixels yet)
- Day 3: asset resolver + kit builder
