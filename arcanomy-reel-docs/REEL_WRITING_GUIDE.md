Goal of this document: "This document outlines a practical writing system for creating engaging, repeatable reel scripts—including virality emotion targeting, hook/body/close patterns, language rules, and an approval rubric—so a reviewer can quickly say yes/no before any production work begins."

# Arcanomy Reel Writing Guide

This guide is referenced by the Reel Manifesto. It focuses on writing craft and approval, not production.

## 1) Write backwards (the order that works)

Write in this order:
1) **Emotion** you want the viewer to feel (choose one)
2) **Action** you want next (share / comment / reflect / try something)
3) **One sentence** you want remembered
4) Then write the script to earn that sentence

Why: viewers don’t remember “content.” They remember a sentence and a feeling.

## 2) Virality emotions (choose one primary)

Pick one primary emotion. If you aim for multiple, you usually get “mildly informative.”

- **LOL (Amusement/Humor)**: irony, absurd contrast, exaggeration (without lying).
- **WTF (Surprise/Shock)**: taboo truth, reversal, pattern break (must stay scoped + defensible).
- **OMG (Awe/Astonishment)**: scale, extreme consequences, big numbers (make magnitude concrete).
- **Aha (Insight/Realization)**: reframe, simple model, “I never saw it that way.” (Arcanomy home base.)
- **Awww (Warmth/Cuteness)**: tenderness, care, belonging, human moments (use sparingly, but powerful).

Rule of thumb:
- Hook triggers the emotion.
- Body earns it.
- Close turns it into a takeaway.

## 3) The “one remembered sentence”

Write the sentence you want repeated out loud.
It should be:
- **short**
- **sharp**
- **true**
- **useful**

Examples (structure, not content):
- “The problem isn’t X. It’s Y.”
- “If you can’t do X, you won’t get Y.”
- “You don’t need more X. You need less Y.”

## 4) Hook patterns (pick one)

Choose one hook shape and commit.

- **Reversal**: “Everyone thinks X. The truth is Y.”
- **Cost/Consequence**: “This is why X keeps failing.”
- **Taboo truth (scoped)**: “Here’s the uncomfortable part about X…”
- **Mistake framing**: “If you’re doing X, you’re accidentally training Y.”
- **Test**: “If you can’t answer this in 5 seconds, you’re guessing.”
- **Micro-story**: “A friend told me something that ruined X for me.”
- **Rule**: “Here’s the rule nobody follows.”

## 5) Body patterns (how to earn the claim)

Pick one earning method:
- **Mechanism**: “Because A → B → C, you get D.”
- **Distinction**: “X looks like Y, but it’s actually Z.”
- **Example**: one specific scenario that makes the claim feel obvious.
- **Tradeoff**: what you gain and what you sacrifice.
- **Myth-bust**: “The myth is X. The reality is Y. The fix is Z.”

## 6) The close (make it shareable)

Your close should do one of these:
- **Rule**: “So the rule is…”
- **Test**: “If you can’t ___, then ___.”
- **Move**: “Do this once today: ___.”
- **Reframe**: repeat the “one remembered sentence” with force.

## Monk mode (hard constraints for discovery consistency)

### Length (words, not vibes)
Assume VO pace ~150–170 wpm:

- **45s (default): 112–128 words**
- **60s (alt): 145–160 words**

Rule: **If it can’t fit the cap, it’s two scripts.**

### Beat template + word budgets
**45s (112–128 words)**
- Hook: **7–10**
- Claim: **18–24**
- Earn it: **64–78**
- Takeaway: **16–22**

**60s (145–160 words)**
- Hook: **10–12**
- Claim: **20–26**
- Earn it: **85–100**
- Takeaway: **20–24**

60s requires a **re-hook** line around ~60–70% (“Here’s the part most people miss: …”).

### Line discipline (makes it speakable)
- **One sentence per line**
- **Max 12 words per line**
- **Max 12 lines total (45s)** / **max 14 lines total (60s)**
- **Max 1 rhetorical question** (hook only)

### No fake receipts (reel-appropriate)
- No “studies show / experts say / research proves.”
- Numbers only if you’re confident. If not, use: **often / tends to / usually / roughly / a lot**.
- If a number is essential but uncertain, label it: **ballpark / directionally / order of magnitude**.

### One earning method (enforced)
The body must use **exactly one** earning method. If you mix two, you’re probably smuggling a second claim.

## 7) Language rules (anti-sludge)

### Hard bans (reels)
- Never say: “studies show”, “research says”, “experts agree”, “scientists believe”.
- Avoid corporate sludge: “leverage”, “utilize”, “in the realm of”, “transformative”.
- Avoid formulaic openers: “Have you ever wondered…”, “What if I told you…”.

### Clarity rules
- Write for a **5th grader** (simple words, simple logic).
- Prefer **short sentences**.
- Use **concrete nouns/verbs** (names, places, actions).
- One claim per script. If it needs “and also,” split it.

### Numbers rule (reels)
- Default to **0–2 numbers** unless it’s a numbers-focused reel.
- No absolutes. Scope the claim to what’s actually supported.
- State numbers plainly (no authority framing). Keep proof notes private.

## 8) Editing (where the magic happens)

Don’t edit while drafting.

Editing passes:
1) **Cut 20%** (remove throat-clearing and repeats).
2) **Tighten verbs** (replace weak verbs with strong ones).
3) **Read-aloud pass** (fix rhythm; remove tongue-twisters).
4) **Hook rewrite** (write 5 hooks; pick the best).

## 9) Approval rubric (fast “yes/no”)

If a reviewer says “no” to 2+ items, rewrite.

- **Hook**: Would you keep listening after the first line?
- **Clarity**: Is the claim unmistakable by sentence 2–3?
- **Earned**: Does the body actually earn the claim (not vibes)?
- **Novelty**: Is this meaningfully different from prior reels?
- **Takeaway**: Is the final sentence repeatable?
- **Truth discipline**: Any “facty” line has private proof notes.
- **Emotion**: Do you feel the chosen emotion (LOL/WTF/OMG/Aha/Awww)?

## 10) Script package format (recommended)

- Emotion target (LOL/WTF/OMG/Aha/Awww)
- Word count (must be in range)
- Remembered sentence (the line you’re earning)
- Script (line-disciplined voiceover)

Reviewer-only (private):
- Proof notes (where the “facty” lines came from in the source)
