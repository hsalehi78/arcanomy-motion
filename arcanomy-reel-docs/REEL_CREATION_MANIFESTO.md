Goal of this document: "This document outlines how to extract one reel-worthy claim from a source text/blog and write an engaging, speakable script that can be approved using clear creative criteria."

# Arcanomy Reel Manifesto

This guide defines the standards for creating a short video reel from a source text/blog.

## 1) What a reel is (purpose)

A reel is a **single sharp idea** delivered in a way that changes what a viewer believes or does.  
It is not a summary. It is not “content.” It is a small act of persuasion.

A good reel:
- makes one claim
- earns it with a reason, example, or evidence from the text
- leaves one takeaway the viewer can repeat

## 2) What we start with

We start with one source text (a blog/article). Our job is to extract **one claim worth repeating**, then speak it clearly.

## 3) The Sacred Constraints (non‑negotiable)

- **One idea**: If it needs “and also…”, it is two reels.
- **Spoken truth**: Write for the mouth, not for the page.
- **No fake authority**: Never say “studies show”, “research says”, “experts agree”, or cite institutions in the reel.
- **No invented numbers**: If a number is not in the text, it does not belong.
- **No vague advice**: The viewer must know what to think or do differently.
- **No throat-clearing**: The first line must earn attention immediately.
- **No repeats**: The claim must not be a re-skin of a previous reel you’ve already made.
  - Before locking a claim, review your archive of past reels (even a simple list of prior claims/titles).
  - If it’s the same premise, same primary idea, or the same signature stat/example, discard it and choose a fresher angle.

## 4) Choosing the claim (what is “reel‑worthy”)

From the source, choose a claim that is:
- **Specific**: it names the thing and the direction (not “be better”).
- **Non‑obvious**: it surprises, corrects, or clarifies.
- **Useful**: it changes a decision, a habit, or a perspective.
- **Earned**: the source contains support (example, reasoning, or evidence).
- **Speakable**: you can say it out loud in one breath without sounding like an essay.

### Forbidden claim types

- pure summaries (“the article talks about…”)
- pure morals (“be kind”, “work hard”) with no mechanism
- claims that require ten definitions first
- anything you cannot defend using the source text

### Output of this step (write it down)

- **Claim** (one sentence)
- **Why it matters** (one sentence)
- **Proof notes (private)**: a short quote/paraphrase + where it appears in the text (not for the reel—only for approval).

## 5) Writing the script (how to think, not a formula)

You are crafting a spoken argument with a clean arc:
attention → clarity → credibility → takeaway.

### The hook (attention)

Goal: make the listener feel “wait—what?”

A hook is not hype; it is **tension + specificity**.

Good hooks:
- a sharp contrast (“Most people think X. The truth is the opposite.”)
- a painful truth (“If you do X, you’re training Y.”)
- a precise consequence (“This is why people fail at Z even when they know better.”)

Bad hooks:
- greetings, introductions, disclaimers
- vague questions (“Have you ever wondered…?”)
- generic motivation

### The body (clarity + credibility)

Goal: make the claim feel inevitable.

Earn it with one of these:
- a simple mechanism (“because… therefore…”)
- one concrete example
- one clean distinction (A vs B)
- one tradeoff (what you gain/lose)

Rules:
- keep sentences short
- prefer concrete nouns and verbs
- delete filler until it feels almost blunt

### The close (takeaway)

Goal: leave the viewer with one sentence they can repeat or act on.

A strong close is:
- a principle (“So the rule is…”) OR
- a test (“If you can’t ___, then ___.”) OR
- a next action (“Do ___ once today.”)

## 6) The Honesty Gate (the “head monk” test)

Before approving the script, ask:

- **Single-sentence test**: Can you state the reel’s idea in one sentence?
- **Proof test (private)**: Which exact part of the text supports each “facty” line?
- **No-miracles test**: Did we smuggle in an assumption the text doesn’t earn?
- **Clarity test**: Would a stranger understand without extra context?
- **Read‑aloud test**: Does it sound like someone speaking, not an essay?
- **Novelty test**: Have we already made this reel (same premise) in different words?

If any answer fails, rewrite.

## 7) Script Quality Checklist (pass/fail)

A script is acceptable only if:
- the first line is strong enough to stand alone
- the claim is stated clearly (not implied)
- the script contains at least one concrete reason/example
- no sentence depends on vague authority
- any “facty” line or number is traceable to the text (in the private proof notes)
- the ending gives one crisp takeaway

## 8) Output (what you hand to the editor / next stage)

You should end with:
- **Claim** (1 sentence)
- **Script** (spoken, clean, honest)
- **Proof notes** (where the support lives in the source)

That is a reel. Everything else is downstream.
