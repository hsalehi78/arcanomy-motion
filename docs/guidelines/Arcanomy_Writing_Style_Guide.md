# ✍️ Arcanomy Writing Style Guide

## 1. Tone: Smart, Human, and Emotionally Grounded

Arcanomy speaks like a financially wise friend — direct, relatable, and grounded in truth.  
It blends *The New Yorker’s* emotional intelligence with *The Hustle’s* clarity and wit.

### Voice Pillars
| Pillar | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Smart** | Evidence-based, data-literate, nuanced. | “Compounding isn’t magic—it’s math that loves time.” |
| **Human** | Uses stories to connect and comfort. | “If you’ve ever felt like your paycheck disappears into a black hole, you’re not alone.” |
| **Empowering** | Never shames, always uplifts. | “You’re not bad with money—you just haven’t been given the right map.” |
| **Bold** | Opinionated but earned. | “Stop chasing high salaries. Start chasing optionality.” |

## 2. Structure: Teach → Show → Apply

Every piece follows a rhythm that builds understanding and emotional payoff.

1. **Hook** — a relatable, emotional opening  
2. **Explain** — simplify the concept (with analogies or visuals)  
3. **Apply** — show real examples, numbers, or charts  
4. **Reflect** — end with a human insight or shift in perspective

> *“We don’t buy time with money—we trade it. Every subscription, every upgrade, every ‘it’s just $20.’ The goal isn’t to stop spending; it’s to stop wasting trades that don’t make your life richer.”*

## 3. Sentence Style

- Short, rhythmic, intentional.  
- Conversational but never sloppy.  
- Replace jargon with metaphors.  
- Use pauses (`—`, `…`, `.`) for rhythm.  

Example:

> ❌ “Asset allocation diversification reduces volatility.”  
> ✅ “Spreading your bets keeps you sane when markets go crazy.”

---

## 4. Word Choice

Avoid:
- Corporate or patronizing tone  
- “Millennial” / “Gen Z” labels  
- Buzzwords or dense financial jargon  

Favor:
- Clarity over cleverness  
- Real examples over theory  
- Inclusive language (“we”, “let’s”)  
- Reflective questions (“If you doubled your savings rate, what would actually change?”)

## 5. Rhythm & Pacing

Readers should feel rewarded every few lines.  
Use micro-rewards: punchy subheads, analogies, one-sentence paragraphs.

> **Bad advice spreads faster than compounding interest.**  
> Everyone wants a shortcut.  
> No one wants to track expenses.  
> But clarity doesn’t come from hacks — it comes from knowing what your money *means.*

## 6. Stylistic Anchors

| Influence | What to Borrow |
|------------|----------------|
| **The New Yorker** | Precision, emotional intelligence |
| **The Hustle** | Conversational wit, brevity |
| **Financial Samurai** | Authority and practical honesty |
| **Morgan Housel** | Timeless storytelling and simplicity |
| **Paul Graham Essays** | Straightforward logic and curiosity |

---

## 7. Consistency by Format

| Format | Voice | Example |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Knowledge Base** | Teacher | “Here’s the logic behind it — no buzzwords, just how it works.” |
| **Playbooks** | Coach | “Let’s map your next move, step by step.” |
| **Tools** | Assistant | “Change the slider to see how a 1% difference compounds.” |
| **Perspectives** | Essayist | “We treat burnout like a moral failure. But it’s often just financial misalignment.” |
| **Social (TikTok/X)** | Hook-driven | “You don’t need more income. You need less drag.” |

## 8. The Arcanomy Lens

Before publishing, ask:
1. Does it make the reader **feel smarter**, not smaller?  
2. Does it offer something **to do**, not just to think about?  
3. Would someone **share it**, saying “this explains how I feel”?  

If yes → it’s Arcanomy.
