# Newsletter Writing Guide

> Essential writing principles for Arcanomy newsletters
> Distilled from the Manifesto, Style Guide, No-AI Rules, and Slippery Slope Principle

## The Core Principle

**The Slippery Slope:**

> "The purpose of the first sentence is to get you to read the second sentence."

Every word exists to pull the reader forward. A well-written newsletter creates a slope so slippery that the reader melts into the copy. They don't stop because they don't want to.

## Voice: Smart Friend Who Gets Finance

Arcanomy newsletters sound like **texting a smart friend** who happens to know a lot about money. Not a financial advisor. Not a professor. A friend.

### Voice Pillars

| Pillar | What It Means | Newsletter Example |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Smart** | Evidence-based, uses real numbers | "That $3 upgrade costs you $50,000 over 20 years" |
| **Human** | Stories that connect and comfort | "If your paycheck feels like it disappears into a black hole, you're not alone" |
| **Empowering** | Never shames, always uplifts | "You're not bad with money. You just haven't had the right map" |
| **Bold** | Opinionated but earned | "Stop chasing high salaries. Start chasing optionality" |

---

## Writing Rules

### 1. Sentence Variation (Critical)

AI writes uniform sentences. Humans don't.

```
❌ Bad (AI): All sentences are 15-20 words. They maintain similar structure. They feel rhythmically identical.

✅ Good (Human): Short sentence. Then a really long one that goes on and on with multiple clauses, parenthetical thoughts (like this one), and keeps developing the idea further. Three words here.
```

### 2. Use Contractions Everywhere

Newsletters are conversational. Contractions are mandatory.

- don't, won't, it's, can't, isn't, doesn't
- "Here's the thing..." not "Here is the thing..."
- "You're not alone" not "You are not alone"

### 3. Paragraph Length Variation

Mix it up constantly:

One sentence sometimes.

Then a longer paragraph that develops the idea fully with examples and maybe even a number or two, like $10,000 sitting in a savings account earning 0.01% interest while inflation eats it alive.

Back to short.

### 4. Number Formatting (Mix It Up)

Never be consistent. Humans aren't.

- Sometimes: $10,000
- Sometimes: $10k
- Sometimes: ten thousand dollars
- Sometimes: 10 grand (informal moments)

### 5. Use Specific Names

Generic = AI. Specific = Human.

```
❌ "a popular coffee chain" → ✅ "Starbucks"
❌ "a streaming service" → ✅ "Netflix"
❌ "a ride-sharing app" → ✅ "Uber"
```

### 6. Write at 5th Grade Level

Hemingway wrote novels at a 5th-grade reading level. You should too.

- Use short sentences (vary 3-25 words)
- Choose simple words over complex ones
- Active voice, not passive
- Remove adverbs and unnecessary modifiers

---

## Structure: Teach → Show → Apply

Every newsletter follows this rhythm:

1. **Hook** — A relatable, emotional opening
2. **Explain** — Simplify the concept (analogies, examples)
3. **Apply** — Real examples, numbers, or what to do
4. **Reflect** — End with a human insight or shift in perspective

---

## Banned Words & Phrases

### Transition Words (Dead Giveaways)

**NEVER USE:**
- Moreover, Furthermore, Indeed, Thus, Therefore
- Consequently, Additionally, Subsequently, Hence
- Nevertheless, Nonetheless, Accordingly

### Corporate/Academic Language

| ❌ Never Say | ✅ Say Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Delve into" | "look at" or just skip |
| "Underscore" | "show" or "prove" |
| "In the realm of" | name the topic directly |
| "Transformative" | "game-changing" or skip |
| "Leverage" (verb) | "use" |
| "Utilize" | "use" |
| "Ever-evolving" | "changing" |

### Vague Attributions

- ❌ "Many studies show..." → Name the study or skip
- ❌ "Experts agree..." → Name the expert or rephrase
- ❌ "Research indicates..." → Cite it or don't mention it

### Formulaic Openings

- ❌ "Have you ever wondered..."
- ❌ "What if I told you..."
- ❌ "Let me ask you this..."
- ❌ "In today's fast-paced world..."

### Buzzword Combinations

- ❌ "Unlock the potential"
- ❌ "Paradigm shift"
- ❌ "Game-changing innovation"
- ❌ "Seamlessly integrate"

### Em-Dashes

- **NEVER use em-dashes (—)**
- Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead
- Breaking this rule is an instant AI tell
- Exception: Sign-off uses regular hyphen "- Hamid"

---

## The Hook

First 2-3 sentences determine if they keep reading.

### Hook Formulas

**1. The Observation Hook**
Notice something universal:
> "You ever notice how your baseline quietly shifts?"

**2. The Plot Twist Hook**
Flip expectations:
> "You think: irresponsible. They think: rational. Plot twist: They might be right."

**3. The Startling Stat Hook**
Lead with a number:
> "Your FIRE timeline assumes 20 years of stable income. AI just cut it to 8."

**4. The "Here's What Happened" Hook**
Tell a micro-story:
> "I caught myself doing that. The nicer coffee. The nicer ride."

---

## Rhythm & Pacing

Readers should feel rewarded every few lines.

Use micro-rewards:
- Punchy subheads
- Surprising analogies
- One-sentence paragraphs
- Bold key phrases
- Specific numbers

**Example of good rhythm:**

> **Bad advice spreads faster than compounding interest.**
> Everyone wants a shortcut.
> No one wants to track expenses.
> But clarity doesn't come from hacks. It comes from knowing what your money *means.*

---

## The Arcanomy Lens

Before sending, ask:

1. Does it make the reader **feel smarter**, not smaller?
2. Does it offer something **to do**, not just to think about?
3. Would someone **share it**, saying "this explains how I feel"?

If yes → it's Arcanomy.

---

## Example Phrases That Work

Use these patterns (not word-for-word):

- "So here's what actually happened..."
- "The math is wild:"
- "Here's the thing..."
- "But wait..."
- "Plot twist:"
- "$10,000 sitting in savings"
- "Your brain literally can't handle this"
- "Not because [X]. Because [Y]."

---

## Anti-AI Detection Checklist

Before sending, verify:

1. **Word Search**: Ctrl+F for banned words (moreover, delve, underscore)
2. **Em-dash Check**: Search for — and replace with commas/periods
3. **Sentence Length**: Are 3+ sentences in a row similar length? Fix it.
4. **Paragraph Scan**: Any 3+ paragraphs the same size? Vary them.
5. **Contraction Count**: Less than 5 per 500 words? Add more.
6. **Brand Test**: Any generic references? Make them specific.
7. **Number Check**: Are all numbers formatted the same? Mix it up.

## Final Reminder

The goal isn't perfect writing. It's writing that connects.

Sometimes that means a paragraph that rambles a bit. Sometimes a sentence fragment. Sometimes starting with "And" or "But."

Because humans don't follow rules consistently.

That's the most human thing of all.
