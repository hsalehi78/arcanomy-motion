## 📚 Core Guidelines

### 1. [Master Writing Principles](master-writing-principles.md)
**FOUNDATIONAL** - Essential wisdom from the world's greatest writers and copywriters.

**Sources:**
- **Stephen King** (*On Writing*) - Craft and authenticity
- **Joseph Sugarman** (*The Adweek Copywriting Handbook*) - Persuasion and emotion
- **Robert Cialdini** (*Influence*) - Psychology of persuasion
- **Hemingway App** - Clarity and readability (5th grade level)

**Key Topics:**

**The Foundation:**
- Read a lot and write a lot (Stephen King's core rule)
- Write with door closed (first draft), rewrite with door open (second draft)
- Complete first drafts quickly (3 months max, even for books)
- Edit ruthlessly: 2nd Draft = 1st Draft - 10%

**Style Principles:**
- Aim for 5th-7th grade reading level (Hemingway standard)
- Avoid passive voice (active voice is powerful)
- Eliminate adverbs (use strong verbs instead)
- Use first word that comes to mind (trust your instincts)

**Psychology of Persuasion (Sugarman):**
- Sell on emotion, justify with logic
- Never sell a product, sell a concept
- The Slippery Slope: Each sentence pulls you to the next
- Every word has an emotion associated with it

**Cialdini's 6 Principles:**
1. Reciprocity - Give value first
2. Scarcity - Limited availability increases desire
3. Authority - Expertise persuades
4. Commitment & Consistency - Small commitments lead to bigger ones
5. Liking - We buy from people we like
6. Consensus (Social Proof) - People follow what others do

**Creative Process:**
- Broad knowledge (read widely, stay curious)
- Specific knowledge (research deeply, become expert)
- First draft will be terrible (that's normal)
- Real writing is rewriting

**Includes:**
- Complete daily habits and toolkit
- Quality checklist before publishing
- How principles align with Arcanomy voice pillars

### 2. [No-AI-Content Guidelines](no-ai-content.md)
**THE MOST CRITICAL FILE** - Rules for making AI-generated content appear naturally human-written.

**Key Topics:**
- Banned transition words and academic language
- Universal anti-AI rules (sentence variation, number formatting, paragraph length)
- Style guides by content type (blog, newsletter, social media)
- 10-step detection test checklist
- AI prompt engineering templates
- Testing with detection tools (GPTZero, Originality.ai, Writer.ai, Copyleaks)

**Critical Rules:**
- ❌ No em-dashes (—) anywhere
- ❌ No banned transitions: Moreover, Furthermore, Indeed, Thus, Therefore, etc.
- ✅ Vary sentence length (3-25 words)
- ✅ Mix number formats (40%, forty percent, 2 out of 5)
- ✅ Vary paragraph length (1-6 sentences)

---

### 3. [Arcanomy Writing Style Guide](Arcanomy_Writing_Style_Guide.md)
**ESSENTIAL** - Core brand voice and tone guidelines.

### 4. [Arcanomy Manifesto](arcanomy_manifesto.md)
**CONTEXT** - Mission, philosophy, and brand promise.

**Key Topics:**

### 5. [The Slippery Slope Principle](the-slippery-slope-principle.md)
**ENGAGEMENT MASTERY** - The psychology of irresistible writing.

**Key Concept:**
- The point of the first sentence is to get you to read the second sentence
- The point of the second sentence is to get you to read the third sentence
- Create momentum that pulls readers forward

**The Spell:**
- Write like you're talking to a 5th grader
- Use words with 1-2 syllables
- Use short sentences
- Use short paragraphs (a few sentences max)
- Create a slippery slope where readers "melt away into the copy"

**Why It Works:**
- Not about perfect grammar or fancy words
- About understanding human psychology
- Creates momentum sentence by sentence
- Aligns with Arcanomy's **Human** voice pillar
